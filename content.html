				<h3>The internet has delivered a wealth of educational resources from various organizations. However, the overwhelming volume and lack of organization across sources can sometimes interrupt the learning process. Finally, due to infrastructural limitations in developing countries, the majority of this content cannot be accessed by schools who need it the most.</h3>

<h3>At LumenEd, we compile this content from different open source providers and help teachers find the materials they need for their classrooms. Additionally, our unique platform enables classrooms to access this content without any stable electricity or internet connection.

					<h2>Digital Library</h2>
					<h4>We've collected and organized over 1500 videos across a range of grades and core subjects in several different languages.

					<h1>What's Next</h1>
					<h3>We are working with new partners in education to expand our content library. We hope to continue to source more content and someday have dedicated contributors to reach a wider audience. This is especially the case with languages other than English, which are often the native languages in developing nations.</h3>
					<h3>In order to make our model more scalable and to increase access to our content library, we need to develop a web portal that would allow anyone with internet to quickly find relevant content. This would allow teachers with access to internet to easily find source content for their classrooms. Finally, since we believe content should be available to anyone, we will soon be establishing routing stations to download and mail content to users who lack access to internet. </h3>
